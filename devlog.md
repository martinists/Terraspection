# Jan 20. 2026 Project Introduction

This project is an application a user utilizes to analyze satellite imagery based on a location chosen by the user 
in order to see the feasibility for plant growth in that area. To do this, I will be leveraging free satellite imagery
from Copernicus' Sentinel-2 Satellite as it allows for NDVI data which is integral to analyzing land feasability for plant growth.

Terraspection will be divided into 2 phases, backend satellite analysis, and frontend user map selection. Before starting, I will need
to download the satellite data and use it with Java to test if the satellite data even works for this project. Then I will begin leveraging
libraries like GeoTools for geospatial data handling. A tools for this project I will be a bit unfamiliar with so it will give me a big opportunity to learn.
